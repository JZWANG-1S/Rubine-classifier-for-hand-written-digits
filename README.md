# Rubine-classifier-for-hand-written-digits
Implement Rubine classifier with MATLAB.

The paper of Rubine classifier is:
Rubine, D. (1991). Specifying gestures by example (Vol. 25, No. 4, pp. 329-337). ACM.

In this project, I performed Rubine classifier for hand-written-digits from 0 to 9.

To start the GUI click INK.m then you can write numbers.
